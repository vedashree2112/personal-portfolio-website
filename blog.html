                <h2>The History of Aliens</h2>
                <p>The flying saucer spiraled out of control. Hit a radio tower before ricocheting off a mountain spur. The dizzy aliens thought they were on their home planet, where they were called “Ezees.” They tried to explain this to paramedics, but were forever known as E.T.’s. The acronym is a lie.</p>

                <h2>Inspiration > Nostalgia</h2>
                <p>Johnny traded his records for cassettes, then traded his cassettes for CD’s, then traded his CD’s for Mp3’s. When his apartment flooded, his computer crashed and his old collections were ruined. He decided the only thing left to do was sing, play guitar, and make some music of his own.</p>

                <h2>Inventory</h2>
                <p>See him then leaving work in Manhattan, 7:15, a summer night, stepping away from Must, feeling Maybe. Disappointing, these years later: he never met someone on the sidewalk open to change. Say a toast to those missed chances on the way to the train—safely carouseled from opportunity, chrysalis denied.</p>

                <h2>One For the Photo Album</h2>
                <p>The snip of rusty scissors as they go about their business. A mix of pictures, past and present; snapshots cut up, faces placed upon the floor. Creating a mosaic. Father, mother, son, daughter. Eyes, smiles, unrecognisable.
                    As his collage takes shape, he patiently waits for the family to return home.</p>
